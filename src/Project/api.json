        "description":"During the 1870 s, three artists emerged changing the face of children s picture books forever. The artists Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott and Kate Greenaway were noteworthy because their books were designed for children. Though Crane and Caldecott are still remembered, the illustrations of Kate Greenaway have endured the test of time and still have a place in today s nursery. The essence of Victorian childhood is exhibited in the idealized children of Greenaway s work. Her dreamy little figures seem almost melancholy as they prance through the English countryside unaware of time or place. Their outfits of frilly smocks, mob caps and sunbonnets seem Regency in appearance but are none-the-less the figments of Miss Greenaway s girlish imagination. They are an outcome of her unwillingness to leave childhood behind. In 'A Treasury of Kate Greenaway Stories' her wonderful illustrations are brought back to life with such children's favorites as: Apple Pie Book of Games Mother Goose The Pied Piper of Hamelin Under the Window Birthday Book (with records section) Book of Tunes"
